# QOTDSML

RFC865 (Quote of the Day) implemented in in Standard ML. 
Tested with Poly/ML and SML/NJ on Linux. 

## Usage

Using SML/NJ:

```bash
smlnj main.sml
```

Compiling using PolyC (Poly/ML):

```bash
polyc main.sml
./a.out
```

## Other implementations

I implement this RFC in various languages to test out the language itself: basic networking, random, types and so on.
